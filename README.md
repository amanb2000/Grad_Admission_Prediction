# Grad_Admission_Prediction
In this notebook, I will be training several scikit learn models to gain a preliminary understanding of the dataset. Following that, I will be training some more customized models with PyTorch in a separate notebook.
## Purpose
The goal here is to understand the dataset and what I should expect from models I train in the future. For this reason, data visualization is a prime focus.

## About the Data Set
The data set is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions#Admission_Predict_Ver1.1.csv). It has 7 features, namely: 
-1. Student index (non-predictive)
0. GRE Score
1. TOEFL Score
2. Univeristy Rating
3. SOP (Statement of Purpose)
4. LOR (Letters of Recommendation)
5. CGPA
6. Research
7. Chance of Admission
